Stock Geometizer is a data visualization tool to determine the desirability of stocks. A geometric shape is generated
based on various factors such as buy recommendations, 3 year growth rate, 26 week price return, and others. 

The inner shape and color represent expert advise for the stock while the outer shape represents trends in firm 
performance such as 3 year growth rate. The more green and the more edges, the more desirable; the more red and 
the less edges, the less desirable.

Compare up to three different stocks using updating financial data to easily inform your investment decisions.
